Project Title: Mod10 Counter with One Second Delay
This project is a digital system design implemented in Xilinx Vivado 2019.1 using Verilog. The system is a mod10 counter that increments every one second.

Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

Prerequisites
You will need to have Xilinx Vivado 2019.1 installed on your machine in order to open and run the designs in this project.

Installing
To get a copy of the project, you can clone or download the repository from GitHub.

git clone https://github.com/Mihirtcd/Xilinx-Vivado-projects.git

Running the design
The design can be opened and run in Xilinx Vivado 2019.1 by opening the .xpr file for the specific design. The design also has its own set of constraints and testbench files, which will also need to be opened and run in Vivado. The design uses a one-second delay to increment the counter.
