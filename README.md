Project Title: Xilinx Vivado FPGA Projects
This project is a collection of Xilinx Vivado designs using Verilog that have been implemented and tested on FPGA. It is developed and tested using Xilinx Vivado 2019.1.

Getting Started:
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

Prerequisites:
You will need to have Xilinx Vivado 2019.1 installed on your machine in order to open and run the designs in this project. Additionally, you will need access to an FPGA development board to test the designs on hardware.
I have used edge spartan 7 FPGA development board as well as Basys 3 Fpga development board.

Installing:
To get a copy of the project, you can clone or download the repository from GitHub.

git clone https://github.com/Mihirtcd/Xilinx-Vivado-projects.git (copy this!)

Running the designs:
The designs can be opened and run in Xilinx Vivado by opening the .xpr file for the specific design. Each design has its own set of constraints and testbench files, which will also need to be opened and run in Vivado. Once the design is successfully implemented, it can be downloaded to the FPGA development board for testing on hardware.
